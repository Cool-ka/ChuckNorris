Hello!
Let me presented the Chuck Norris Joke App, created in React.
You can fetch 10 Chuck Norris jokes and like your favourite ones to be displayed in favourite tab. If some of the favourites no longer make you laugh, simply unlike them. If you feel lucky, click 'Fetch random jokes' on the favoutive tab and see it being populated (up to 10 jokes) with random ones (each 5 seconds). You can also toggle it off. Your favourite jokes stay favourite on refresh!

There was a time constraint of 8 hours and I tried to build it with that in mind. If more time would be allowed I would make following improvements:
* add visual changes to indicate toggle function on fetch random jokes button
* add visual indcation to clicked like button
* manage the clicked tab state to stay on the same page after refresh
* restructure app into smaller components
* extract more utils functions


In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## `yarn run cypress open`

Launches the cypress test runner (please keep app running).\
